## 🎮 Game Rules

Queens Game is a strategic puzzle game with the following rules:

- Place exactly one queen in each row, column, and colored region of the board.

- The game is won when all constraints are satisfied.

## ✨ Features

- **Guaranteed Unique Solution**: No guessing required - every puzzle can be solved through logical deduction
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Click cells to cycle through empty, marked (X), and queen states
- **Real-time Validation**: Instantly see conflicts highlighted on the board
- **Assisted Mode**: Automatically mark cells that cannot contain queens (toggle on/off)
- **Undo Feature**: Made a mistake? Easily undo your moves
- **Multiple Board Sizes**: Choose from 6x6, 8x8, or 10x10 boards
- **Hint System**: Get help when you're stuck
- **Game Timer**: Track how long it takes you to solve each puzzle
- **Responsive Design**: Play on desktop or mobile devices

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Start a new game** by clicking the "New Game" button or changing the board size.
2. **Place queens** by clicking on cells. Each click cycles through three states:
   - Empty: No mark
   - Marked (X): Indicates a cell that can't contain a queen
   - Queen: A queen is placed on the cell
3. **Use logical deduction**:
   - Each row, column, and colored region must have exactly one queen
   - No queens can touch (including diagonally)
4. **Watch for conflicts**: Queens in conflict will be highlighted in red
5. **Win the game** by correctly placing all queens on the board

The region generation algorithm:

1. Places predefined Tetris-like templates (L-shapes, T-shapes, Z-shapes, etc.)
2. Ensures all regions are connected
3. Creates patterns with varied shapes and sizes
4. Balances region sizes for fair difficulty
5. Verifies each puzzle has exactly one solution
